# Simple OCR

Task:

Prepare 3 white&black separate images with letters. Prepare white&black image with text for OCR. Write Matlab script for searching choosen letter in text using correlation method (e.g. xcorr2() and find()).

*Comments are in Enghlish. Some variables are left in Polish but in my opinion this will not affect the readability of the code.
